# Voron Afterburner Toolhead PCB Cover

This cover is made for the tool head PCB from hartk. To mount the cover, please use a 22 mm M3 screw. The sleeve is used as spacer between PCB and cover.

It should be also possible to use the cover without the PCB. For that you have to design and print a custom sized sleeve part.
