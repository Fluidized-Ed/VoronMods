# Voron Afterburner Toolhead PCB Cover

This cover is made for the tool head PCB from [HARTK](https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/3D-Printing/PCBs/Afterburner_Toolhead_PCB). To mount the cover, please use a 22 mm M3 screw. The sleeve is used as spacer between PCB and cover.

It should be also possible to use the cover without the PCB. For that you have to design and print a custom sized sleeve part.

## New version with AirVents

This is an updated version to the cover with air vents for better air flow to the termistor on the PCB.
