# Skirt Fan Mount

![alt text](https://github.com/craxoor/VoronMods/blob/master/Skirt%20Fan%20Mount/Images/Preview-Front.png)

To screw the fans in place, eight M3 heat inserts have to be inserted in the fan mount. U can use the heat inserts which are listed in the Voron BOM.

The cutout at the top (where the mount gets attached to the printer frame) can be used for cable management. This may only work for smaller cable diameters on the fan. I have installed two 12V fans in series to use them on the 24V controller output.
